## 1. Introduction
Welcome to **NoSugar**! This Privacy Policy explains how **NoSugar** ("the extension") collects, uses, and protects your data. **NoSugar** is an open-source Chrome extension developed by **Fajar S. Lubis** ("I", "me", "my") to enhance the Wire open-source chat app by providing seamless message translation.

## 2. Data I Collect
**NoSugar** collects minimal data necessary for its functionality. Specifically, the extension may collect the following:

- **Chat Message Content:** When you use the translation feature, the content of the selected message is sent to the **Google Cloud Translate API** for translation purposes. No messages are stored or logged by me or the extension itself.
- **User Preferences:** Settings like preferred language and translation preferences are stored locally in your browser using Chrome's `storage` API.

**No personal information** such as names, emails, or passwords is collected or stored.

## 3. How Your Data is Used
The data collected is used solely for the following purposes:

- **Message Translation:** The extension sends selected chat messages to the **Google Cloud Translate API** for translation.
- **User Preferences Management:** Stored preferences ensure a consistent and personalized experience.

I do **not** use your data for marketing, advertising, or tracking purposes.

## 4. Data Sharing
I do **not** sell, rent, or trade your data. However, to perform translations, your selected text is sent to the **Google Cloud Translate API**.

## 5. Data Storage and Security
- **Message Content:** Messages sent to the Google Cloud Translate API are **not** stored by me or the extension itself.
- **User Preferences:** Preferences are stored locally within your Chrome browser via the Chrome `storage` API. This data is never transmitted externally.

While I take reasonable measures to ensure data security, please remember that no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure.
